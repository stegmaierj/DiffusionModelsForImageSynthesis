## Annotation-Free Segmentation in Fluorescence Microscopy Image Data using Diffusion Models

### UNDER RECONSTRUCTION

<br>
This repository contains code to simulated 2D/3D cellular structures and synthesize corresponding mircorscopy image data based on Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM).
Sketches indicating cell shapes and structural characteristics serve as a basis for the diffusion process and allow for the generation of fully-annotated microscopy image data sets without the need of human annotations.<br><br>
